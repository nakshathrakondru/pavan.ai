# Pavan – Air Quality Monitoring System

Pavan is a web application designed to help users easily understand the air quality of a selected location. The system presents environmental data in a simple visual interface so that non-technical users can quickly interpret pollution levels and make informed decisions.

The project focuses on usability and clarity — instead of showing raw sensor values, the application converts data into readable indicators and visual feedback.
